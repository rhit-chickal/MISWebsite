    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I work a part-time job as a Expense Data Auditor for my momâ€™s accounting firm. She has a wide variety of clients who own businesses and have a significant amount of transactions which need to be categorized. I mainly do this work because I love working with spreadsheets and I also love working with her clients. However, often, the business owners are very disorganized and we have to go through a very large amount of transaction data and sort it by category. This can cause a resource constraint on our end and can significantly increase cost of services for the clients due to the time spent on their projects. There is a more efficient way to achieve results in this process.</p>
    <p>Through standardizing a spreadsheet template and running it through the database, we can create summaries of these expense categories and even break it down by vendor as well. Therefore, my project is to create an expense database for an accounting firm. The database will help the firm break down expense categories for businesses. It will use a standard template uploaded from Excel and can easily break down the spreadsheet into each separate expense category and have a summary of these expenses. </p>
    <p>The summaries can help with a variety of tasks. When my mom is preparing tax returns and inputting expenses for businesses, this categorization is helpful for her to easily input the exact values without estimation. Additionally, sometimes clients get audited and this breakdown helps organize the raw transaction data that has to be searched through. Lastly, my mom advises businesses on their operations as part of her services. Seeing a breakdown can help her determine if the client is spending too much in certain categories of expenses and it can help with comparisons to what businesses of similar kind are spending in certain areas.</p>
