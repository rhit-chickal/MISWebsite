    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is Mandy Chick and I am a Senior at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering along with two Minors: Economics and Entrepreneurial Studies. â€‹In addition, at the same time, I am working on completing my Master's Degree in Engineering Management through R Squared.</p>

<p>I have had 3 internships in Engineering. My first was as a Production Engineering Intern at Toyota Material Handling. My last two internships were as a Design Engineer Intern at General Motors. I have accepted a full-time position with General Motors as a Design Engineer, so I will be relocating to Michigan in January. </p>

<p>My long-term goals are widespread. I plan to grow my small business, Victory 23 Designs, from 3D printing to include different additive manufacturing techniques, laser cutting, fabrication, and custom design projects. Additionally, I am planning on pursuing my Juris Doctorate Law degree starting next August and eventually becoming an intellectual property attorney.</p>
